Hey, thanks for stopping by üëã

I‚Äôve been programming for about 15 years now, and along the way I‚Äôve grown into an enthusiastic Infrastructure Engineer with a passion for complex web-based systems and cloud architecture (mainly AWS-focused). I‚Äôve worked on everything from building websites using best practices for scalability, to designing hybrid cloud systems and data-heavy administration platforms. What started out as curiosity and a lot of late nights learning to code has turned into a career and hobby that keeps me always experimenting, breaking stuff, and putting it back together in new ways.

When I‚Äôm not writing code, you‚Äôll usually find me in my home lab. It‚Äôs my playground for trying out new tech, running experiments, and learning by tinkering. Sometimes it‚Äôs smooth sailing, other times it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpull everything apart and start fresh‚Äù kind of day ‚Äî and honestly, that‚Äôs part of the fun.

I‚Äôm also into home automation. Since getting into Arduino programming a few years back, I‚Äôve been building out my own automation system using a mix of proprietary and open-source solutions, along with off-the-shelf components (mostly based on the ESP32 chipset). That‚Äôs led me to create custom lighting and power controls around my home, add multiple sensors for climate, security, and CCTV, and tie it all together with schedules and voice commands. The main goal? Making everyday life easier and more efficient ‚Äî while learning the mechanics and principles of the code behind it.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôve got a real love for nature and photography. A lot of that comes through caring for my succulent and orchid collection, but I also enjoy getting out and exploring the countryside with a camera in hand. It‚Äôs a nice balance to all the screen time ‚Äî one foot in the digital world, and one in the natural one.

This blog is my space to share some of that journey ‚Äî the projects, the experiments, the lessons learned, and maybe a few of the mistakes along the way too.

If you‚Äôre into coding, home labs, automation, or even just geeking out about plants and photography, I think we‚Äôll get along just fine. üöÄüå±üì∏
